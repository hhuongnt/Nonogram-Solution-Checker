+ Introduction:

  A nonogram is a puzzle game in which you fill in pixels to complete a picture.

  Along the edge of the puzzle grid, there are numbers which give you the clues about that column or row. These numbers show how many pixels on that particular line will be filled in.

+ The project is to write a function **is_nonogram_resolved** that takes two arguments **specifications** and **solution** which respectively corresponds to the specifications of a nonogram and a proposed solution, and returns True if the suggested solution successfully matches the nonogram's specifications, False otherwise.

+ Function: Check solution and specifications
  * Print 'True' if the suggested solution is right for the specifications.
  * Print 'False' otherwise.

+ How to use:
  1. Open terminal, type:
  git clone http://gitlab.intek.edu.vn/nonogram-solution-checker/nhuong

  2. Open nhuong directory

  3. Open file **is_nonogram_resolved.py**

  4. Edit the specifications and solution to check

  5. Type in terminal
  python3 is_nonogram_resolved.py

  6. Enter and see the result
